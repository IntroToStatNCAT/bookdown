#Probability Basics Worksheet

**Quick Review:**
The starting point in studying probabilities is the concept of an _experiment or random process_, by which we mean some act or observation whose outcome is not known in advance. Simple examples would be 

$\bullet$	Rolling a die
$\bullet$	Tossing a coin twice
$\bullet$	Observing the temperature at GSO at 3:00 pm this afternoon (Fo) 

Although we cannot predict what we will observe, we can in some cases compile a list of all the outcomes we might observe. This is known as the [**sample space**].{underlined} for the experiment, and is a set in mathematical terms, that is to say a collection of distinct items. Generally for a sample space of n possible outcomes we write S = {E1, E2, ... , En} . For example in the die rolling experiment we have S={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and in the coin tossing experiment we could list the outcomes as S={TT, TH, HT, HH}. It is a little harder to list the sample space for the third experiment, given the current temperature a list of the numbers between 40 and 80 would probably suffice. 

We use the outcomes in the sample space for computing probabilities for any event according to the following basic rule: 

$$
\textbf{P(A) = the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes in the event A}
$$

**Events** in probability are just the same as sets in mathematics, so you should know the principle operations on sets: 

$\bullet$	UNION: A U B (“A or B”) is the set of all outcomes in A or in B or in both
$\bullet$	INTERSECTION: A ∩ B (“A and B”) is the set of outcomes that are in both A and B
$\bullet$	COMPLEMENT: Ac (“not A”) everything outside of A (but in S)
