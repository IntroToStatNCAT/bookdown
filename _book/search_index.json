A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from Parameter and Statistic A descriptive measure (for example, average, median, standard deviation and percentages) for an entire population is a ’‘parameter.’’ A descriptive measure for a sample is referred to as a ’‘sample statistic’’ Observational studies and Experiments Observational studies: research processes where researchers collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise (examine something without manipulating it) Experiment: Researchers randomly assign subjects to various treatments in order to establish causal connections between the explanatory and response variables Four commonly used random sampling techniques: 1. Simple random sampling Stratified sample Cluster sampling Multistage sampling Principles of experimental design: 4 principles Controlling (assign treatment and control groups, enforce specific treatment in treatment group) Randomization (randomly assign treatment group and control group); Replication (large sample, or replicate an entire study to verify earlier findings) Blocking Exercise 1. (page 11 #1.2) Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses is summarized below (with some cells missing numbers): (for b), c), Round answers to within one hundredth of a percent) Self-reported improved in symptoms Yes No Total Treatment 66 85 Control 65 Total 166 (a). Fill the blank cells in the above table. (b). What percent of patients in the treatment group experienced improvement in symptoms? (c). What percent experienced improvement in symptoms in the control group? (d). In which group did a higher percentage of patients experience improvement in symptoms? (e). Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients in the antibiotic and placebo treatment groups that experience improvement in symptoms of sinusitis? (Answers for reference: (a). Self-reported improved in symptoms Yes No Total Treatment 66 19 85 Control 65 16 81 Total 131 35 166 (e). Be careful: Do not generalize the results of this study. It is impossible to tell merely by comparing the sample proportions because the difference could be the result of random error in our sample. Exercise 2.

(a). How many cases in the data? (b). Identify the types of variables. Exercise 3. (page 19 #1.4) The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence (evidence based only on personal observation) suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. (a). Identify the main research question of the study. (b). Who are the subjects in this study and how many are included? (c). What are the variables in the study? Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. If numerical, state whether the variable is discrete or continuous. (Reference answer: (a). The effect of Buteyko method on reducing asthma symptoms and improving quality of life. (b). Asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment; 600. (c). The variables and types are: quality of life (categorical), activity (categorical), asthma symptoms (categorical), and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10 (numerical discrete).) Exercise 4. (page 29 #1.13) Exercise 1.3 introduces a study where researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study, air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations; lengths of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993; and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. (a). Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study. (b). Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships. (Reference answer: Population: all births in Southern California. Sample: collected length of gestation data of 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993. If the collected lengths of gestation data of births in this time span and geography can be considered representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational, the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.) Exercise 5. A fitness center is interested in the average amount of time a client exercises in the center each week. Match the vocabulary words (a-f) with its corresponding examples (1-6).

All clients at the fitness center. The average amount of time that all clients from the fitness center exercise. The amount of time that any given client from the fitness center exercises. The average amount of exercise time for the 45 clients from the fitness center who participated in the study. Vocabulary words: Data Population Variable Sample Parameter Statistic Exercise 6. (Observational Study or Experiment) You would like to investigate whether listening to music while taking exams affects performance. A group of students are told to listen to music while taking a test and their results are compared to a group not listening to music. Is this an experiment or an observational study? The starting salaries of recent graduates from Ivy League private and public universities are recorded. Is this an experiment or an observational study? Exercise 7. (page 37 #1.41) In a public health study on the effects of consumption of fruits and vegetables on psychological well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) diet as usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to take a nightly survey on their smartphones. Participants were student volunteers at the University of Otago, New Zealand. At the end of the 14-day study, only participants in the third group showed improvements to their psychological well-being across the 14-days relative to the other groups. (a). What type of study is this? (b). Identify the explanatory and response variables. (c). Comment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population. (d). Comment on whether the results of the study can be used to establish causal relationships. (e). A newspaper article reporting on the study states, “The results of this study provide proof that giving young adults fresh fruits and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits even over a brief period of time.” How would you suggest revising this statement so that it can be supported by the study? (Reference answer: (a). Experiment (b). Explanatory: treatment group (categorical with 3 levels). Response variable: Psychological well-being. (c). No, because the participants were volunteers. (d). Yes, because it was an experiment. (e). The statement should say “evidence” instead of “proof”.)

Simple examples would be \\(\\bullet\\ \\ \\text{Rolling a die} \\\\ \\\\\\) \\(\\bullet \\ \\ \\text{Tossing a coin twice} \\\\ \\\\\\) \\(\\bullet \\ \\ \\text{Observing the temperature at GSO at 3:00 pm this afternoon (Fo)} \\\\\\) Although we cannot predict what we will observe, we can in some cases compile a list of all the outcomes we might observe. This is known as the \\(\\underline{\\textbf{sample space}}\\) for the experiment, and is a set in mathematical terms, that is to say a collection of distinct items. Generally for a sample space of n possible outcomes we write \\(S = {E1, E2, ... , E_n}\\) . For example in the die rolling experiment we have \\(\\textit{S={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}\\) and in the coin tossing experiment we could list the outcomes as \\(\\textit{S={TT, TH, HT, HH}}\\) It is a little harder to list the sample space for the third experiment, given the current temperature a list of the numbers between 40 and 80 would probably suffice. We use the outcomes in the sample space for computing probabilities for any event according to the following basic rule: \\[ \\textbf{P(A) = the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes in the event A} \\] Events in probability are just the same as sets in mathematics, so you should know the principle operations on sets: \\(\\bullet\\) UNION: A \\(\\cup\\) B (“A or B”) is the set of all outcomes in A or in B or in both \\(\\bullet\\) INTERSECTION: A \\(\\cap\\) B (“A and B”) is the set of outcomes that are in both A and B \\(\\bullet\\ \\ \\text{COMPLEMENT: Ac (“not A”) everything outside of A (but in S)}\\) It is important to realize that A \\(\\cup\\) B, A \\(\\cap\\) B, and \\(A^c\\) are all sets, that is to say, they are collections of \\(\\textit{distinct}\\) items, and no element may be listed twice. For example, with reference to the die rolling experiment, define the event B as “a number at least as great as 5 comes up”, so B={5,6}. For A={2,4,6} (an even number comes up), we have \\(\\bullet\\ \\ \\ A \\cup B \\text{={2,4,5,6},}\\\\ \\\\\\) \\(\\bullet \\ \\ \\ A\\cap B \\text{={6},}\\\\ \\\\\\) \\(\\bullet \\ \\ A^c \\text{={1,3,5}}, \\\\\\) \\(\\bullet \\ \\ B^c \\text{={1,2,3,4}}\\) Suppose the die is assumed to be fair. This, by definition, means that each side is equally likely to come up when the die is rolled. If we assign a total probability of 1 to the entire sample space, then we should assign a probability of 1/6 to each of the 6 outcomes in the sample space, so \\[ \\text{P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/6.} \\] Thus, we should obtain: \\(P(A) = \\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}\\) \\(P(B) = \\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}\\) \\(P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}\\) \\(P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1}{6}\\) \\(P(A^c) = \\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}\\) \\(P(A^c) = \\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}\\) Some points worth noting: \\(\\bullet\\) P(A U B) = 4/6 does NOT equal P(A) + P(B) = 5/6 (this is because the two sets have an element, 6, in common). \\(\\bullet\\) P(Ac) = 1 - P(A) and P(Bc) = 1 – P(B). \\(\\bullet\\) Also note that in cases where all the outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, the rule about adding the probabilities for all of the outcomes in the event simplifies to counting the number of outcomes in the event and dividing by the number out outcomes in the sample space. So, for the events A and B above, P(A) = 3/6 = 1⁄2, and P(B) = 2/6 = 1/3. \\(\\bullet\\) Generally, if A contains m outcomes, and the sample space has n equally likely outcomes (so the probability for each outcome is 1/n), then P(A) = m/n. At this stage, let us write down some general rules or AXIOMS for probability. The events A, B below are now general events in a sample space, not the specific ones described above. For any sample space, P(S) = 1 For any event A, 0 \\(\\le\\) P(A) \\(le\\) 1 General addition rule: If A and B are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability that at least one of them will occur is \\[ \\text{P (A or B) = P (A) + P (B) - P (A and B) } \\] where P(A and B) is the probability that both events occur. Here, A or B occurs means A, B, or both A and B occur. 4)Addition rule for disjoint events: For any events A, B which have no common outcomes, \\[ \\text{P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)} \\] Events which have no outcomes in common are often referred to as mutually exclusive (or \\(\\textit{disjoint}\\)). If two events A, B are mutually exclusive, we write P(A \\(\\cap\\) B) = \\(\\emptyset\\) , where \\(\\emptyset\\) is referred to as the \\(\\textit{empty set}\\). It is sort of equivalent to the number zero in arithmetic. Note that using the first and third rules, we have \\(1 = P(S) = P(A \\cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)\\) ) , so we have a general rule that for any set \\(A, \\ P(A^c) = 1 – P(A)\\). This is often called the law of complements. Exercise 1. A set of 11 cards is numbered 1 through 11. A card is picked at random and the following events defined: A - the number on card is odd: B - the number on the card is 5 or higher. Find P(A) = P(B) = P(A and B) = P(A or B) = Exercise 2. (Sample space where the outcomes are NOT equally likely): Professor Donald Fraser of the University of Toronto constructed a (purposely) uneven die. On inspection it was clear that the sides would not have equal probability. He rolled it 12,800 times, and came up with the following empirical probabilities (based on relative frequency): Side 1 2 3 4 5 6 Probability 0.186 0.179 0.207 0.137 0.149 0.142 For the events A (even number) and B (at least 5) compute: \\(\\text{P(A) =}\\) \\(\\text{P(B) =}\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)=\\) \\(P(A\\cap B) =\\) \\(P(A^c) =\\) \\(P(B^c) =\\) Exercise 3. A group of 1000 students is classified by gender \\(G_1\\) (male) or \\(G_2\\) (female), and by year, \\(\\textbf{Y}_1\\) (freshman), \\(\\textbf{Y}_2\\) (sophomore), \\(\\textbf{Y}_3\\) (junior), or \\(\\textbf{Y}_4\\) (senior). This results in the following table: Freshman (\\(Y_1\\)) Sophomore (\\(Y_2\\)) Junior (\\(Y_3\\)) Senior (\\(Y_4\\)) Total Male (\\(G_1\\)) 140 120 110 70 440 Female (\\(G_2\\)) 160 130 140 130 560 Total 300 250 250 200 1000 If a student is randomly selected, find the probability that the student: Is a junior, P(\\(Y_3\\)) = Is a female freshman, P(\\(G_2\\) and \\(Y_1\\)) = Is a male or a junior, P(\\(G_1\\) or \\(Y_3\\)) = d)Is not a freshman, P(not \\(Y_1\\)) = Is not a male and is not a junior, P(not \\(G_1\\) and not \\(Y_3\\)) = Exercise 4. Here is the “Craps Game” sample space, where a red and a green die are rolled.

Identify which pairs of events are disjoint.

Notes: The requirement that the sample size \\(n &lt; 10\\%\\) of population size is to have the standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\). If the sample size \\(n &lt; 10\\%\\) of population size, then the \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\) is overly estimated SD, and the SD will typically adjust by a factor \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{N-n}{N-1}}\\),i.e. \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{N-n}{N-1}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\). When using \\(\\hat{p}\\) to estimate \\(p\\), the Standard Error of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution: \\(S.E._{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\) When \\(p\\) is unknown, \\(\\hat{p}\\) is used to replace \\(p\\) then check \\(n\\hat{p} \\geq 10\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{p}) \\geq 10\\) (success and failure condition) estimated \\(S.E. \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\) Exercise 1 In a random sample with size \\(n=9000\\), the count of “yes” is \\(x=250\\).

Introduction Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of adult Americans who believe that immigration is a good thing for the U.S. It is unreasonable to expect that we could survey every adult American. Instead, we use a sample of adult Americans to arrive at an estimate of the proportion. We call this estimate a point estimate. 9.1 Point Estimate Definition: A point estimate is the value of a statistic (based on a sample) that estimates the value of a population parameter. The sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) We now study categorical data and draw inference on the proportion, or percentage, of the population with a specific characteristic. If we call a given categorical characteristic in the population “success” then the sample proportion of successes, p, is: \\[\\hat{p}= \\frac{x}{n} \\] Where x is the number of individuals in the sample with a specified characteristic and n is the sample size. Example 1: The Gallup Organization conducted a poll in which a simple random sample of 1,520 adults, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia were asked the following question. “Thinking now about immigrants – that is, people who come from other countries to live here in the United States, in your view, do you think legal immigration is a good thing or a bad thing for this country today?” If 1135 responded “Yes”. Obtain a point estimate for the proportion of Americans 18 and older who believe that immigration is good for the US. Solution: \\[\\hat{p}= \\frac{1135}{1520} = 0.747\\] We estimate for the proportion of Americans 18 and older who believe that immigration is good for the US is 74.7% Note: We agree to round proportions to three decimal places. Sampling distribution of sample proportions \\(\\hat{p}\\) 9.1.1 The Central Limit Theorem for proportions The Central Limit Theorem for proportions states that if n is large enough, then: \\(\\hat{p}\\sim N \\left( p, \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\right)\\) Therefore, a different random sample of adult Americans might result in a different point estimate of the population proportion, such as \\(\\hat{p}= 0.71, \\hat{p}= 0.78, \\ldots\\). If the method used to select the sample of Americans was done appropriately, both point estimates would be good guesses of the population proportion. Due to variability in the sample proportion, we need to report a range (or interval) of values, including a measure of the likelihood that the interval includes the unknown population proportion. 9.1.2 Confidence Interval A confidence interval for an unknown parameter consists of an interval of numbers based on a point estimate. The level of confidence represents the expected proportion of intervals that will contain the parameter if a large number of different samples is obtained. The level of confidence is denoted \\((1 - \\alpha) \\times 100\\%\\). For example, a 95% level of confidence \\((\\alpha = 0.05)\\) implies that if 100 different confidence intervals are constructed, each based on a different sample from the same population, we will expect 95 of the intervals to contain the parameter and 5 not to include the parameter. Confidence interval estimates for the population proportion are of the form: Point estimate \\(\\pm\\) margin of error. The margin of error of a confidence interval estimate of a parameter is a measure of how accurate the point estimate is. The margin of error depends on three factors: Level of confidence: As the level of confidence increases, the margin of error also increases. Sample size: As the size of the random sample increases, the margin of error decreases. Standard deviation of the population: The more spread there is in the population, the wider our interval will be for a given level of confidence. Confidence Interval on Proportion, p Suppose that a simple random sample of size \\(n\\) is taken from a population. A \\((1 - \\alpha) \\times 100\\%\\) confidence interval for p is given by the following quantities: \\(\\hat{p}\\pm z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\) Where p = Theoretical or “True” population proportion Confidence Level \\(1 - \\alpha \\times 100\\%\\) \\(\\alpha\\) \\(Z^* = Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) 0.90 0.10 1.645 0.95 0.05 1.96 0.98 0.02 2.33 0.99 0.01 2.58 The Z-table is used to find the critical values, \\(Z^*\\), for confidence intervals on the true proportion p. This abbreviated table gives the most common z-scores for the centered values of confidence for the normal curve. Example 2: In July of 2008, a University Poll asked 1783 registered voters nationwide whether they favored or opposed the death penalty for persons convicted of murder 1123 were in favor. Obtain a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of registered voters nationwide who are in favor of the death penalty for persons convicted of murder. Solution: \\(\\hat{p} = \\frac{1123}{1783} = 0.63\\) Where: n = 1783 \\[ np \\ \\&amp; \\ n(1-p) &gt; 10 \\] Lower bound: \\(0.63 - 1.645 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.63(1-0.63)}{1783}} \\approx 0.61\\) Upper bound: \\(0.63 + 1.645 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.63(1-0.63)}{1783}} \\approx 0.65\\) We are 90% confident that the proportion of registered voters who are in favor of the death penalty for those convicted of murder is between 0.61 and 0.65. Estimating the margin of error on p for a given confidence level Consider the scenarios for the product of proportion and complements for the margin of error. What happens as the proportion changes? \\[ (1 - \\alpha)\\% CI \\text{ on } p = \\hat{p} \\pm Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\] Where: \\(\\hat{p}\\) = Point estimate \\(Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\) = Margin of Error = \\(Z_{critical} \\times Standard Error\\) Determine the Sample Size Necessary for Estimating a Population Proportion within a Specified Margin of Error Two possible solutions: Use an estimate of p based on a pilot study Use the value of p which gives the largest possible value of \\(n\\) for a given confidence level \\(\\&amp;\\) margin of error. Sample Size Needed for Estimating the Population Proportion The sample size required to obtain a \\((1 - \\alpha)\\) - 100% confidence interval for \\(p\\) with a margin of error E is given by: \\[ n = \\frac{p(1-p) \\left( \\frac{Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}}{E} \\right)^2}{rounded \\text{ up to the next integer}}, \\text{ where } p \\text{ is a prior estimate of } p. \\] \\(n\\) Approximate Margin of Error 500 0.045 (or 4.5%) 800 0.035 (or 3.5%) 1000 0.032 (or 3.2%) 1500 0.026 (or 2.6%) If a prior estimate on the proportion is unavailable, using \\(\\hat{p} = 0.5\\) will give the following estimate for the sample size: \\[ n = 0.25 \\times \\left( \\frac{Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}}{E} \\right)^2 \\] Gallup and other polling agencies report at the 95% confidence level and assume p = 0.5 in calculating the margin of error: Example 3 The statistic presented below appeared in the weekly magazine TIME, August 23, 1993, under the article Danger in the Safety Zone. Consider the tiny print “From telephone poll of 500 adult Americans taken for TIME/CNN. Margin of error is \\(\\pm 0.45\\)”. Do you favor the death penalty? YES NO 77% 17% From a telephone poll of 500 adult Americans taken for TIME/CNN on Aug. 12 by Yankelovich Partners, Inc. Margin of error is \\(\\pm 0.45\\) Explain how the margin of error can be calculated. Solution: Margin of Error in the article (under 95% confidence) is about: \\[ 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 \\times 0.5}{500}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{500}} = 0.04472 \\approx 4.5\\% \\] Example 2 Illustrating the Meaning of Level of Confidence Using Simulation : Let’s illustrate what “95% confidence” means in a 95% confidence interval in another way. We will simulate obtaining 200 different random samples of size n=50, m=50 i.e., n equals 50 from a population with p=0.7, p equals 0.7. Figure 4 shows the confidence intervals in groups of 100. A green interval is a 95% confidence interval that includes the population proportion, 0.7. A red interval is a confidence interval that does not include the population proportion. (For now, ignore the blue intervals.) Notice that the red intervals that do not capture the population proportion 0.7 have centers that are far away (more than 1.96 standard errors) from 0.7. Of the 200 confidence intervals obtained, 10 (the red intervals) do not include the population proportion. For example, the first interval to miss has a sample proportion that is too small to result in an interval that captures 0.7. (Note: The actual image illustrating the confidence intervals would be embedded here using \\(\\text{![ ]()}\\) if the image file was provided.) Appeal: Simulating Confidence Intervals (rossmanchance.com) A 95% level of confidence means that 95% of all possible samples result in confidence intervals that include the parameter (and 5% of all possible samples result in confidence intervals that do not include the parameter). Caution! A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains the parameter (such as p). Remember, probability describes the likelihood of undetermined events. Therefore, it does not make sense to talk about the probability that the interval contains the parameter since the parameter is a fixed value. Thinking of this way: If a coin and obtain a head. If I ask you to determine the probability that the flip resulted in a head, it would not be 0.5, because the outcome has already been determined. Instead, the probability is 0 or 1. Confidence intervals work the same way. Because p or \\(\\mu\\) is already determined, we do not say that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains \\(\\mu\\). Exercises As a potential worldwide pandemic, avian influenza H5N1 (commonly called the bird flu) poses a serious health risk. As of January 24, 2012, there have been 583 human cases of this virus in the world. Of these cases, 344 have resulted in death. Consider the outcomes of these cases as a random sample of all possible outcomes. Find a point estimate for the proportion of people who would die if infected with the bird flu. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of cases that would be expected to result in death if a pandemic occurred. Interpret the confidence interval. A sociologist wanted to determine the percentage of residents of America that only speak English at home. What size sample should be obtained if she wishes her estimate to be within 3 percentage points with 90% confidence assuming she uses the estimate obtained from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey of 82.4%? Nitrates are groundwater contaminants derived from fertilizer, septic tank seepage, and other sewage. Nitrate poisoning is particularly hazardous to infants under the age of 6 months. The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) is the highest level of a contaminant that government allows in drinking water. For nitrates, the MCL is 10 mg/L. The health department wants to know the proportion of wells in Madison County that have nitrate levels above the MCL. A worker has been assigned to take a simple random sample of wells in the county, measure the nitrate levels, and assess compliance. What size sample should the health department obtain if the estimate is desired to be within 2 percent with 95% confidence if: there is no prior information available? a study conducted two years ago showed that approximately 7% of the wells in Madison County had nitrate levels exceeding the MCL.

When we know the population is normal, no matter what sample size, \\(\\bar{x} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\) Notes: When using \\(\\bar{x}\\) to estimate \\(\\mu\\) the Standard Error of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution: \\(S.E. = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) Usually \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown use \\(s\\) to replace \\(\\sigma\\): \\(S.E. \\approx \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) When can the CLT be applied If \\(n \\geq 30\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) is known If the population is normal and \\(\\sigma\\) is known Otherwise we use t-distribution: \\(T = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim t_{df}\\), where \\(df=n-1\\) is the degree of freedom. t-distribution Similar to the standard normal distribution: the probability density curve of a t-distribution is centered at 0, and it is bell-shaped. But tails of a t-distribution are thicker than that of the standard normal distribution; moreover, the lower \\(df\\), the thicker the tails. Using R to find probability under t-distribution with \\(df=n-1\\): For \\(P(T &lt; b)\\): pt(b, df) For \\(P(T &gt; a)\\): pt(a, df, lower.tail = FALSE) or 1 - pt(a, df) For \\(P(a &lt; T &lt; b)\\): pt(b, df) - pt(a, df) To find the cut-off point \\(t\\) (critical value \\(t^*\\) or \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\)) for a given cumulative probability with \\(df=n-1\\): Find \\(t\\) for \\(P(T &lt; t) = p\\): qt(p, df) Find \\(t\\) for \\(P(T &gt; t) = p\\): qt(1 - p, df) or qt(p, df, lower.tail = FALSE) \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\): \\(P(T &gt; t_{\\alpha/2})\\) = \\(\\alpha/2\\): \\(qt(\\alpha/2, df, lower.tail = FALSE)\\) 100\\((1-\\alpha)\\%\\) Confidence interval for mean \\(\\mu\\) Using sample with size \\(n\\), sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\), sample standard deviation \\(s\\), the critical value \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\): \\(\\bar{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) Margin of Error (M.E.) \\(M.E. = t_{\\alpha/2} \\times S.E. = t_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) Hypothesis Testing for mean \\(\\mu\\) – one sample t test (Same framework as the Hypothesis Testing for proportion) Steps: Set up the hypotheses Compute the t test statistic Using sample with size \\(n\\), sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\), sample standard deviation \\(s\\), null value \\(\\mu_0\\), \\(T = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\) Compute the p-value Let t-test statistic \\(t_1 = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\) (from step 2) For left-sided test, p-value is \\(P(T &lt; t_1)\\) use pt(t, df) For right-sided test, p-value is \\(P(T &gt; t_1)\\) use pt(t, df, lower.tail = FALSE) For two-sided test, p-value is \\(P(|T| &gt; |t_1|)\\) use \\(2*pt(-|t_1|, df)\\) or \\(2*pt(|t_1|, df, lower.tail = FALSE)\\) Compare the p-value with the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) and make decision If p-value \\(\\leq \\alpha\\), then we have enough evidence to reject \\(H_0\\) and substantiate \\(H_a\\); If p-value &gt; \\(\\alpha\\), then we do not have enough evidence to reject \\(H_0\\) The default value of significance level is \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) Exercise 1 Without finding the values, arrange the numbers from small to large: \\(P(Z &lt; -1.25)\\) \\(P(T &lt; -1.25)\\) with \\(df=10\\) \\(P(T &lt; -1.25)\\) with \\(df=15\\) \\(P(Z &gt; 1.35)\\) \\(P(T &gt; 1.35)\\) with \\(df=10\\) \\(P(T &gt; 1.25)\\) with \\(df=15\\) \\[ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ &lt; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ &lt; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ &lt; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ &lt; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ &lt; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\] Exercise 2 Use R calculator to find the values of the probability of t-distribution.

(Simple) linear regression is to study if the relationship between two numerical variables is linear, and the strength of the linear association. We begin with the scatter plot of two numerical variables, to observe if there is a linear association. If there seems to be a linear relationship, we use the linear model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\) to best fit the data. Using a sample data set \\((x_i, y_i)\\) for \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\) and least squares error, we derive an estimated model \\(\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x\\). Prediction (Predicted value) If the least square regression model is given by \\(\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x\\), then for a given \\(x\\), the predicted value is \\(\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x\\) – plug in the value of \\(x\\). Interpreting the slope and the y-intercept of a regression line The slope \\(b_1\\) is the amount by which the predicted value \\(y\\) changes when \\(x\\) is increased by one unit. The y-intercept \\(b_0\\) is the predicted value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\). Residual For a data set \\((x_i, y_i)\\) for \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\), the error of using the model is: \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i = y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i)\\) The Correlation Coefficient The mathematical formula is: \\(R = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{s_x s_y}\\) The value of \\(R\\): \\(-1 \\leq R \\leq 1\\) The closer \\(|R|\\) is to 1, the stronger the linear association. The Coefficient of Determination: \\(R^2\\) The coefficient of determination \\(R^2\\) is a measure used in statistical analysis to assess how well a model explains and predicts future outcomes. \\(R^2\\) is the proportion (fraction) of the variation in the response variable that is predictable (can be explained) from the explanatory variable. Conditions to have the least squares regression Visually inspect the scatter plot: The relationship between the explanatory and the response variable should be linear. The histogram of residuals distribution should be normal (symmetric, bell-shaped). The variability of points should be roughly constant. No extreme outliers. Computing the coefficients in \\(\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x\\) \\(b_1 = \\frac{s_y}{s_x} R\\) \\(b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}\\) Notes \\(R\\) and \\(b_1\\) have the same sign. Equivalently, \\(R = \\frac{s_x}{s_y} b_1\\) Exercise 1 Describe the linear relationship from the scatter plot. Select the correct choice. (a) Strong positive relationship (b) Strong negative relationship (c) Weak positive relationship (d) Weak negative relationship Exercise 2 The mean travel time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is 129 minutes, with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean distance from one stop to the next is 108 miles with a standard deviation of 99 miles. The correlation between travel time and distance is 0.636. (a) Write the equation of the regression line for predicting travel time (based on the distance). (b) Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context. (c) Calculate and interpret \\(R^2\\). (d) The distance between Santa Barbara and LA is 103 miles. Use this model to estimate the time it takes to travel between these two cities. (e) It actually takes the Coast Starlight about 168 minutes to travel between Santa Barbara and LA. Calculate the residual. Is the model over or underestimating the time?
