# Inference for Numerical Data

**Basic Terms**

-   Sample mean $\bar{x}$ is the unbiased **point estimator** for the population mean $\mu$
-   A value of $\bar{x}$ is a point estimate
-   Error = $\mu - \bar{x}$

## Central Limit Theorem (Sampling distribution of sample mean)

When taking samples of fixed size $n$ from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, when the observations are independent (take random samples of fixed size $n$, without replacement); the sample size $n \geq 30$, then the sample proportion $\bar{x}$ is approximately normal: $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$.

When we know the population is normal, no matter what sample size, $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

**Notes:**

-   When using $\bar{x}$ to estimate $\mu$ the Standard Error of $\bar{x}$ is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution: $S.E. = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
-   Usually $\sigma$ is unknown use $s$ to replace $\sigma$: $S.E. \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

**When can the CLT be applied**

-   If $n \geq 30$ and $\sigma$ is known
-   If the population is normal and $\sigma$ is known
-   Otherwise we use t-distribution: $T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{df}$, where $df=n-1$ is the degree of freedom.

**t-distribution**

Similar to the standard normal distribution: the probability density curve of a t-distribution is centered at 0, and it is bell-shaped. But tails of a t-distribution are thicker than that of the standard normal distribution; moreover, the lower $df$, the thicker the tails.

**Using R to find probability under t-distribution with** $df=n-1$:

-   For $P(T < b)$: `pt(b, df)`
-   For $P(T > a)$: `pt(a, df, lower.tail = FALSE)` or `1 - pt(a, df)`
-   For $P(a < T < b)$: `pt(b, df) - pt(a, df)`

**To find the cut-off point** $t$ (critical value $t^*$ or $t_{\alpha/2}$) for a given cumulative probability with $df=n-1$:

-   Find $t$ for $P(T < t) = p$: `qt(p, df)`
-   Find $t$ for $P(T > t) = p$: `qt(1 - p, df)` or `qt(p, df, lower.tail = FALSE)`
-   $t_{\alpha/2}$: $P(T > t_{\alpha/2})$ = $\alpha/2$: $qt(\alpha/2, df, lower.tail = FALSE)$

**100**$(1-\alpha)\%$ Confidence interval for mean $\mu$

Using sample with size $n$, sample mean $\bar{x}$, sample standard deviation $s$, the critical value $t_{\alpha/2}$: $\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

**Margin of Error (M.E.)**

$M.E. = t_{\alpha/2} \times S.E. = t_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

**Hypothesis Testing for mean** $\mu$ -- one sample t test (Same framework as the Hypothesis Testing for proportion)

**Steps:**

1.  Set up the hypotheses

2.  Compute the t test statistic

    Using sample with size $n$, sample mean $\bar{x}$, sample standard deviation $s$, null value $\mu_0$,

    $T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

3.  Compute the p-value

    Let t-test statistic $t_1 = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ (from step 2)

    -   For left-sided test, p-value is $P(T < t_1)$ use `pt(t, df)`

    -   For right-sided test, p-value is $P(T > t_1)$ use `pt(t, df, lower.tail = FALSE)`

    -   For two-sided test, p-value is $P(|T| > |t_1|)$ use $2*pt(-|t_1|, df)$ or $2*pt(|t_1|, df, lower.tail = FALSE)$

4.  Compare the p-value with the significance level $\alpha$ and make decision

    -   If p-value $\leq \alpha$, then we have enough evidence to reject $H_0$ and substantiate $H_a$;

    -   If p-value \> $\alpha$, then we do not have enough evidence to reject $H_0$

    -   The default value of significance level is $\alpha = 0.05$

**Exercise 1**

Without finding the values, arrange the numbers from small to large:

a)  $P(Z < -1.25)$\
b)  $P(T < -1.25)$ with $df=10$\
c)  $P(T < -1.25)$ with $df=15$\
d)  $P(Z > 1.35)$\
e)  $P(T > 1.35)$ with $df=10$\
f)  $P(T > 1.25)$ with $df=15$

$$ \_\_\_\_\_\_ < \_\_\_\_\_\_ < \_\_\_\_\_\_ < \_\_\_\_\_\_ < \_\_\_\_\_\_ < \_\_\_\_\_\_ $$

**Exercise 2**

Use R calculator to find the values of the probability of t-distribution. Sketch the t-curve and shaded region.

-   $P(T < -1.25)$ with $df=10$
-   $P(T < -1.25)$ with $df=15$
-   $P(T > 1.35)$ with $df=10$
-   $P(T > 1.25)$ with $df=15$

**Exercise 3**

Use R calculator to find the critical t-value $(t_{\alpha/2})$, rounded the result to 4 decimal places.

-   CL = 90%, $n = 7$
-   CL = 98%, $n = 20$
-   CL = 99%, $n = 28$
-   CL = 95%, $n = 9$

**Exercise 4**
