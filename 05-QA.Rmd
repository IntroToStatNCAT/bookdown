# Introduction to Linear Regression

## Linear Regression

-   Regression analysis concerns the study of relationships between quantitative variables: identifying, estimating, and validating the relationship.

-   (Simple) linear regression is to study if the relationship between two numerical variables is linear, and the strength of the linear association.

-   We begin with the scatter plot of two numerical variables, to observe if there is a linear association.

-   If there seems to be a linear relationship, we use the linear model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ to best fit the data.

-   Using a sample data set $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$ and least squares error, we derive an estimated model $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x$.

**Prediction (Predicted value)**

If the least square regression model is given by $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x$, then for a given $x$, the predicted value is $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x$ -- plug in the value of $x$.

**Interpreting the slope and the y-intercept of a regression line**

-   The slope $b_1$ is the amount by which the predicted value $y$ changes when $x$ is increased by one unit.

-   The y-intercept $b_0$ is the predicted value of $y$ when $x = 0$.

**Residual**

For a data set $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, the error of using the model is: $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i)$

**The Correlation Coefficient**

-   The mathematical formula is:

$R = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}$

-   The value of $R$: $-1 \leq R \leq 1$

-   The closer $|R|$ is to 1, the stronger the linear association.

**The Coefficient of Determination:** $R^2$

-   The coefficient of determination $R^2$ is a measure used in statistical analysis to assess how well a model explains and predicts future outcomes.

-   $R^2$ is the proportion (fraction) of the variation in the response variable that is predictable (can be explained) from the explanatory variable.

**Conditions to have the least squares regression**

Visually inspect the scatter plot:

-   The relationship between the explanatory and the response variable should be linear.
-   The histogram of residuals distribution should be normal (symmetric, bell-shaped).
-   The variability of points should be roughly constant.
-   No extreme outliers.

**Computing the coefficients in** $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x$

$b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R$

$b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$

**Notes**

1.  $R$ and $b_1$ have the same sign.

2.  Equivalently, $R = \frac{s_x}{s_y} b_1$

**Exercise 1**

Describe the linear relationship from the scatter plot.

Select the correct choice.

*(a)* Strong positive relationship

*(b)* Strong negative relationship

*(c)* Weak positive relationship

*(d)* Weak negative relationship

**Exercise 2**

The mean travel time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is 129 minutes, with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean distance from one stop to the next is 108 miles with a standard deviation of 99 miles. The correlation between travel time and distance is 0.636.

*(a)* Write the equation of the regression line for predicting travel time (based on the distance).

*(b)* Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.

*(c)* Calculate and interpret $R^2$.

*(d)* The distance between Santa Barbara and LA is 103 miles. Use this model to estimate the time it takes to travel between these two cities.

*(e)* It actually takes the Coast Starlight about 168 minutes to travel between Santa Barbara and LA. Calculate the residual. Is the model over or underestimating the time?
