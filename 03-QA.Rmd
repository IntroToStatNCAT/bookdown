# Binomial Distribution

## Binomial Distribution Condition

Conditions to be satisfied for a Binomial Variable Distribution with a fixed number of trials $n$:

-   The trials are independent
-   Each trial has two possible outcomes classified as success or failure
-   The probability of a success $p$ is the same for each trial

**Probability Mean and Standard Deviation**

For a binomial random variable $X$ with $n$ trials and the probability of a single trial being a success $p$, the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes is

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \quad (k = 0, 1, \ldots, n)
$$

Where: - $n! = 1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times n$ - $0! = 1$ - $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ (read as “n choose k”, also called the combination coefficient)

Mean: $\mu = np$

Standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$

Observations that are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean are considered unusual:

Unusual if outside of $\mu - 2\sigma$ and $\mu + 2\sigma$

**Shape of Binomial Distribution**

-   For $p < 0.5$: skew to the left
-   For $p > 0.5$: skew to the right
-   For $p = 0.5$: symmetric (centered at $\mu$)
-   For large $n$, if $np \geq 10$ and $n(1-p) \geq 10$, the graph is approximately bell-shaped.

**Using R**

-   For $P(X = k)$: `dbinom(k, n, p)`

-   For $P(X \leq k) = P(X < k+1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + \cdots + P(X = k)$: `pbinom(k, n, p, lower.tail = TRUE)` (the `lower.tail = TRUE` can be omitted)

-   For $P(X > k) = P(X \geq k+1) = 1 - P(X \leq k) = P(X = k+1) + \cdots + P(X = n)$: `pbinom(k, n, p, lower.tail = FALSE)`

-   For $n!$: `factorial(n)`

-   For $\binom{n}{k}$: `choose(n, k)`

**Using Calculator**

1.  For $P(X = x)$:
    -   `2ND` → `VARS` (`DISTR`) → use arrow to select `binompdf` (enter $n$, $p$, $x$) then `enter`
2.  For $P(X \leq x)$:
    -   `2ND` → `VARS` (`DISTR`) → use arrow to select `binomcdf` (enter $n$, $p$, $x$) then `enter`
3.  For $n!$:
    -   Example: $7!$
    -   Enter 7 then press `Math` key; use (right) arrow key to select `PROB` then use (down) arrow key to select `!` (press enter it then shows `7!`); press the `enter` key again (to get answer 5040)
4.  For $\binom{n}{k}$:
    -   Example: $\binom{9}{2}$
    -   Enter 9 then `MATH` → arrow to `PROB` → choose `nCr` then enter 2 then `enter` to get the result (answer is 36)

**Exercise 1**. How many ways can we choose 2 students from a group of 6?

**Exercise 2** (Combination Formula)

| $k = 1$   |                     |                |                                      |

| $k = 3$   |                     |                |                                      |
| $k = 4$   |                     |                |                                      |

-   $n = 5$, $k = 3$, $p = 0.2$

**Comment**

<p>

Whether it’s unusual depends on your chosen significance level. If you consider a low probability (e.g., p\<0.05) as unusual, then it might be considered unusual.

**Is it unusual if 10 out of 20 randomly selected dog owners buy their dog holiday presents? Why?**

```{r}
dbinom(10,20,0.75)
```

<p id="binom">

**Comment**

<p>

Whether it’s unusual depends on your chosen significance level. If you consider a low probability as unusual, then it might be considered unusual.
