# Summarizing data

## Examining Numerical Data

**Quick Review:**

**1. Graphical Presentations**

-   Scatter graph—present related two numerical data, see if there is any association, outliers
-   Dot plot –see overall pattern outliers
-   Histogram – see the shape of data distribution: modals, skewness

**2. Numerical summaries**

-   Mean, Median -- both measures are for the center of numerical data
-   Mean $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$\
-   Median is the middle value of the arranged data
-   Standard Deviation —measures the spread or variation
-   Quartiles, interquartile range,
-   Five number summary: Min, Q1, Q2, Q3, Max
-   Use the mean and the standard deviation for symmetrical data or large data
-   Use the median and interquartile range for skewed data

**3. R functions codes**

-   `c(?,?,?)` -- concatenate function put multiple values in a vector
-   `mean(c(?,?,?))` -- mean
-   `var(c(?,?,?))` -- variance
-   `sd(c(?,?,?))` -- standard deviation
-   `median(c(?,?,?))` – median
-   `quantile(c(?,?,?), quantile.type=2)` \# change type to 6, if n=5
-   `IQR(c(?,?,?), quantile.type=2)` \# change type to 6, if n=5
-   `summary(c(?,?,?), quantile.type=2)` \# change type to 6, if n=5

**Exercise 1.** Use the following dot plot of an interest rate of some loan data to answer questions.

![](images/img23.png){width="352"}

(a). How many loans?

(b). What is the lowest interest rate? What is the highest interest rate? Find the range.

(c). Find the mean (average).

(d). Find the median.

Help: Using R,

-   `x <- c(5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17, 17, 18, 118, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26)`

-   `length(x)`

-   `mean(x)`

-   `median(x)`

(Answer: (a) 50 (b) 5; 26; 21 (c) 13.48 (d) 10)

**Exercise 2.** When we have a distribution where all observations are greater than 0, that is, all $x_i > 0$, the statistic $\frac{\text{mean}}{\text{median}}$ can be used as a measure of skewness. What is the expected shape of the distribution under the following conditions? Sketch the shape to illustrate.

(a) $\frac{\text{mean}}{\text{median}} = 1$

(b) $\frac{\text{mean}}{\text{median}} < 1$

(c) $\frac{\text{mean}}{\text{median}} > 1$

**Exercise 3.** For given two data sets: Data (1): 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Data (2) 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30

(a). Sketch the dot plots.

(b). Compare their means. What general observation can you draw?

(c). Compare their standard deviations. What general observation can you draw?

(d). What about their IQRs?

**Exercise 4.** Find the quartiles and interquartile range (IQR) for each data set.

(a). 2, 5, 10, 12, 16

(b). 2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 16

**Exercise 5.** The histogram below shows the ages (in years) available for sale in a car dealership on some day.

![](images/img24.png){width="305"}

(a). How many cars are in the first class (between 2 and 4)? In the third class (between 6 and 8)?

(b). Describe the shape of the histogram – how many modals? Symmetric or skewed (left or right)?

(c). Which measure is more appropriate to use to measure the center? Mean or median?

(d). Which measure is more appropriate to use to measure the spread? Standard deviation or IQR?

**Exercise 6.** Identify the histogram for the frequency distribution below.

| Bin      | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| [2, 7]   | 3         |
| [7, 12]  | 2         |
| [12, 17] | 3         |
| [17, 22] | 6         |

(a). Write the five number summary.

## Examining Categorical Data

**Quick Review:**

1.  Tables

-   Frequency of a category – the count of that category
-   Relative Frequency of a category = $\frac{\text{Frequency in the category}}{\text{Total number of observations}}$
-   Table (of one variable) – shows the list of values and the corresponding frequencies (or relative frequencies) of one categorical variable
-   Contingency table—presents a summary (of counts or proportions) of two categorical variables bivariate variables
-   Computing row and column proportions for contingency table

2.  Bar plots

-   Bar plot of one variable – visualizes the frequencies (or relative frequencies) of one categorical variable
-   Bar lots for two categorical variables – put side by side bar plots
-   Stacked bar plot – stack bars over (using different colors)
-   Mosaic plot – is a special type of standardized stacked bar plots that represents a contingency table. In detailed words, it shows the percentage of one categorical variable (variable 1) for all categories of another variable (variable 2); can use the width of each bar to represent the ratio of variable 2)

3.  Using **side by side Box plots** for exploring categorical-numerical relationships which provide information about how the distribution of the numeric variable changes across categories.

4.  R codes (table and bar plot)

<!-- -->

1)  Create a table — use table()

`Variable_Name = c ("category 1", "Category 2", …, "Category n")   (Note: use quotation marks for strings – categories)`

`table(Variable_Name)`

2)  Create Bar plot – (sample from course notes)

`# Create a data frame with the Variable_Name`

`Variable_Name <- data.frame(`

`Type = c("category 1", "Category 2", …, “Category n"),`

`Frequency = c( f1,f2, …, fn)  # f1,f2, …,fn are frequencies`

`# Create a bar plot`

`barplot(Variable-Name$Frequency, names.arg = Variable-Name$Type,`

`main = "Frequency of Variable-Name",`

`xlab = "Type of Variable", ylab = "Frequency",`

`col = "blue", border = "black",    )`

**Exercise 1.** A survey polled a sample of 350 students for a proposed change of some regulations. The following table summarized the survey response result.
